Welcome to Web Element's Documentation.

Please install [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com). Then in the top right of this page, click the "Code" button, and click "Open with GitHub Desktop" from the dropdown.

From here you can "Commit to main" any changes locally, and then sync remotely using the top right most "Origin" button.

Then install [Obsadian](https://obsidian.md/), open the files downloaded with Github Desktop, and then visit the [[Welcome]] page to get started.

You're also free to quickly edit the files straight on this [Project's GitHub](https://github.com/Elements-Agency/documentation), but you will not get auto complete and linking features.
